### Disclaimer
**This project contains several implementations of cryptographic algorithms.
Although these implementations were carefully tested, please do not use them in
any high-risk environments, since the implementations may contain severe flaws
that the maintainers of the project are not aware of.**

### Description
This is the demo-version of the cryptanalytic tool. The project is planned to
contain several implementations of cryptographic algorithms as well as
some attacks on these algorithms.
**NB: Work in Progress**
